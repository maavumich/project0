To clone this project, run the command:

		git clone https://github.com/maavumich/project0

...in a terminal. This will create a directory in the present working
directory ("`PWD`") called `project0` that contains all of the files in
this repository.

# Training Project 0

The basics of C++. Basic syntax, header files, Linux terminal
commands. The optional zeroth project in the core training sequence.

Trainees will write functions that solve "basic coding knowledge interview
questions", as well as the additional "infrastructure" needed to compile
that code. Trainees will also learn how to Linux.

The goal of Training Project 0 is to bring trainees up to speed with the
particulars of C++ syntax and the quirks of coding in the language.

Instructions and pass requirements are found in the `./docs` folder inside
`./docs/assignment.md`.
